    "Analysis was performed on the data set to determine school performance on several metrics, including school spending per student, school size, and school type. School performance was determined by averaging math and reading scores, using the averages to calculate based on a passing score of 70, and then determing the overall passing rate as a combination of math and reading passing rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "School spending was categorized by the following spending ranges per student:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - <$585\n",
    "    - $585-630\n",
    "    - $630-645\n",
    "    - $645-680\n",
    "\n",
    "The best performing schools spent the least amount of money per student as measured by % Overall Passing Rate (90.4% Overall passing). There's a direct negative correlation between spend and passing rate as passing rate decreases as per student spend increases. The bottom performing schools (overall passing rate of 53.5%) fell in the highest spending per student bracket.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schools of small (<1000 students) and medium (1000-2000 students) size performed similarly well as measured by % Overall passing rate (89.9% and 90.6% respectively). Large schools (2000-5000 students) significantly underperformed with a passing rate of 58.3%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Charter schools significantly outperformed district schools with an overall passing rate of 90.4% vs 53.7% respectively. \n",
